# Speed Detector

  This JavaScript program takes the speed of a car  and calculates demerit points based on the specified criteria. It then prints the appropriate message according to the number of demerit points.

## Execution
  
  The program defines a function calculateDemeritPoints that calculates demerit points based on the input speed and a predefined speed limit.
  
  The main function takes the  speed, calls calculateDemeritPoints, and logs the appropriate message based on the demerit points.
  
   Example : If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints: 'Ok'.
  
  If the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, it calculates and prints the demerit points

  If the demerit points exceed 12, it prints: 'License suspended.'
