#  Student Grade Generator
This JavaScript program prompts the user to input student marks and calculates the corresponding grade based on the specified grade ranges.

The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

 A > 79
 B - 60 to 79
 C - 59 to 49
 D - 40 to 49
 E - less than 40.

The grade generator will give outcomes depending on the  marks input.

For marks greater than 79, it prints: "Grade: A".
For marks between 60 and 79, it prints: "Grade: B".
For marks between 50 and 59, it prints: "Grade: C".
For marks between 40 and 49, it prints: "Grade: D".
For marks less than 40, it prints: "Grade: E".
